End of life is not fun, please check your apps once in a while.

Here's why:
* Legacy is no bueno
* Upgrading takes time
* Non-tech individuals are dumbdumbs and will probably not understand why it costs a fair amount of money.

Of course, you are free to do whatever you want.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started 

This is an example of how you may give instructions on setting up your project locally.
To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

I need to do a proper makefile.... yikes

Anyway ...
- [Installation](docs/INSTALLATION.md)
- [Configuration](docs/CONFIGURATION.md)

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

The usage of this cli is pretty straight forward.
Once you have setup the cli properly, **checkout [Getting Start](#getting-started) if you have missed it**, you can simply run


Simply run ```eol-checker```
```eol-checker -h``` will show usage and list of command

```bash
EOL is a CLI library for project version management. 
 This application is a tool to check wether or not your application version is out of date. 
For now it checks on endoflife.date endpoints but is subject to change in the future

Usage:
  eol-cli [flags]

Flags:
  -c, --config string     Configuration file to use (default "eol-cli.yaml")
  -d, --disable-message   Disables the notifications on all plugins
  -h, --help              help for eol-cli
  -v, --version           Display the current version of this CLI
```
